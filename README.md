# C3.MonoGame.Primitives2D

This is simply the XNA Primitives Shapes project project ported over to MonoGame.
I updated the refrences to refrence the MonoGame framework and nothing more.
I wrote none of this code. This is the project page: http://jcpmcdonald.com/libraries/2d-xna-primitive-shapes/ 
and the bitbucket repository https://bitbucket.org/C3/2d-xna-primitives/wiki/Home .

Those sources hold documentation on how to use this library. I have found it very useful in my projects.

Here is a copy of the license, also included in this repository as license.txt
